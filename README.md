Neighborhood Complaint Management System

The Neighbor Complaints Management System is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage and resolve community-related issues. It allows residents to register, submit complaints related to problems such as noise, garbage, or parking, and track the status of their complaints. Administrators can view all complaints, update their status, record actions taken, and ensure timely resolution. The system improves communication, transparency, and accountability between residents and management while reducing manual work and response time.
